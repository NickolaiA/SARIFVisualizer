# Introducing SARIF Visualizer: Transform Your Security Scan Reports into Actionable Insights

*Published: October 26, 2025*

## The Challenge of Modern Security Analysis

In today's software development landscape, security scanning tools are essential. Whether you're using ESLint, Snyk, CodeQL, SonarQube, or Semgrep, these tools generate crucial security and code quality findings. But there's a problem: the output format.

Most security tools export their results in SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) - a standardized JSON format that's great for machine processing but challenging for humans to digest. Opening a raw SARIF file in a text editor reveals thousands of lines of nested JSON that's nearly impossible to navigate efficiently.

**What if you could visualize all that data in seconds, without installing anything?**

## Meet SARIF Visualizer

SARIF Visualizer is a modern, responsive web application that transforms complex SARIF reports into beautiful, interactive dashboards. Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, it provides security teams, developers, and DevOps engineers with instant insights into their code quality and security posture.

The upload page greets you with a clean, modern interface. Simply drag and drop your SARIF file, or click to browse. The application also provides a sample file so you can explore features immediately without needing your own SARIF data.

### 📊 Rich Visual Dashboard

![Dashboard Overview](20250926-screenshots/dashboard.png)

The moment you upload a SARIF file, you're greeted with a comprehensive dashboard featuring:

- **Summary Statistics**: Total issues, severity breakdown, and fixable issues at a glance
- **Severity Distribution**: Beautiful pie charts showing the proportion of errors, warnings, and notes
- **Rule Breakdown**: Bar charts identifying which rules trigger the most findings
- **File Impact Analysis**: Visualize which files have the most issues
- **Tool Information**: See which analysis tools were used and their versions

### 🔍 Advanced Filtering and Search

![Findings Explorer](20250926-screenshots/findings.png)

The Findings Explorer goes beyond simple lists:

- **Multi-dimensional Filters**: Filter by severity (error, warning, note, info), specific rules, or affected files
- **Real-time Search**: Search across issue messages instantly
- **Smart Sorting**: Sort by severity, rule ID, or file location
- **Quick Navigation**: Jump directly to detailed views with one click

### 📚 Comprehensive Rule Directory

![Rules Directory](20250926-screenshots/rules.png)

Understanding the "why" behind findings is crucial:

- **Complete Rule Catalog**: Browse all rules with descriptions and metadata
- **External Documentation**: Direct links to official documentation for each rule
- **Usage Statistics**: See how many issues each rule has identified
- **Category Classification**: Rules organized by category and CWE classification

### 📄 Detailed Issue Analysis

*Note: Detailed issue view shows comprehensive information including code locations, descriptions, and vulnerability enrichment data.*

When you need to dig deep:

- **Complete Context**: Full issue descriptions with Markdown support
- **Code Locations**: Precise file paths, line numbers, and column positions
- **Snippet Preview**: See the problematic code in context
- **Related Locations**: Understand issue chains and related code sections
- **Fix Suggestions**: View automated fix suggestions when available
- **CVE/CWE Enrichment**: Automatic vulnerability database lookups for security issues

## Key Features That Set Us Apart

### 🔗 Vulnerability Enrichment

SARIF Visualizer automatically enriches security findings with information from CVE and CWE databases. When it detects a security vulnerability, it fetches:

- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Severity ratings and CVSS scores
- Remediation recommendations
- External references and resources

This transforms a simple "SQL Injection" finding into actionable intelligence with context and guidance.

### ⚡ Performance Optimized

Large SARIF files can contain thousands of findings. We use Web Workers to parse files in the background, ensuring the UI remains responsive even with massive reports. Upload a 50MB SARIF file, and you'll still get instant feedback.

### 📱 Fully Responsive

Whether you're reviewing findings on your development workstation, presenting results on a projector, or checking issues on a tablet during a meeting - SARIF Visualizer adapts perfectly to any screen size.

### 🎨 Modern, Intuitive UI

Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is clean, modern, and easy to navigate. Color-coded severity badges, intuitive icons, and thoughtful spacing make information dense reports easy to digest.

### 🔒 Privacy First

SARIF Visualizer is completely client-side. Your SARIF files never leave your browser. Everything happens locally, so your sensitive security data remains private and secure.

## Supported Analysis Tools

SARIF Visualizer supports the [SARIF 2.1.0 specification](https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/sarif-v2.1.0.html), making it compatible with a wide range of security and code quality tools:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Static Analysis** | ESLint, TSLint, Pylint, RuboCop |
| **Security Scanners** | Snyk, CodeQL, Fortify, Checkmarx |
| **Code Quality** | SonarQube, SonarCloud, PMD |
| **Vulnerability Detection** | Semgrep, Bandit, Brakeman |
| **Container Security** | Trivy, Clair, Anchore |
| **Cloud Security** | Prowler, ScoutSuite, CloudSploit |

And many more! If a tool can export SARIF, SARIF Visualizer can visualize it.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Security Team Dashboard

A security team receives SARIF reports from multiple scanning tools across different projects. Instead of manually parsing JSON files or dealing with tool-specific UIs, they:

1. Upload all SARIF files to SARIF Visualizer
2. Use the dashboard to identify critical issues across projects
3. Filter by specific vulnerability types (e.g., all SQL injections)
4. Export findings with enriched CVE/CWE data for incident reports

### Use Case 2: CI/CD Pipeline Integration

A DevOps engineer wants to review scan results before approving deployments:

1. CI/CD pipeline generates SARIF reports from security scans
2. Pipeline artifacts include the SARIF file
3. Engineer downloads the artifact and uploads to SARIF Visualizer
4. Quickly reviews the dashboard to make go/no-go decisions
5. Drills into specific high-severity findings when needed

### Use Case 3: Developer Code Review

A developer receives a PR review comment about potential security issues:

1. Runs the security scanner locally (e.g., `eslint --format sarif`)
2. Opens SARIF Visualizer running on `localhost:99`
3. Uploads the SARIF file
4. Identifies all issues in their changes
5. Uses the enrichment data to understand proper fixes
6. Validates fixes by re-running the scanner

## Getting Started in 3 Steps

    container_name: sarifvisualizer
    ports:
      - "99:80"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then: `docker-compose up -d`

**Option C: Build from Source (For Developers)**

```bash

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Is my SARIF data sent to a server?

**A:** No. SARIF Visualizer is completely client-side. All processing happens in your browser. Your security data never leaves your machine.

### Q: What's the file size limit?

**A:** There's no hard limit, but very large files (>100MB) may take longer to parse. We use Web Workers to keep the UI responsive during parsing.

### Q: Can I use this in my CI/CD pipeline?

**A:** Yes! Run SARIF Visualizer as a Docker container in your pipeline, or generate HTML reports programmatically. We're working on a headless mode specifically for CI/CD.

### Q: Does it work offline?

**A:** The Docker image includes everything needed to run offline. The only external calls are for CVE/CWE enrichment, which gracefully degrades if offline.

### Q: Can I customize the look and feel?

**A:** Currently, the theme is fixed. Dark mode and custom themes are on our roadmap. The source code is available if you want to build a custom version.

### Q: What browsers are supported?

**A:** All modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari. We test on the latest two versions of each.
